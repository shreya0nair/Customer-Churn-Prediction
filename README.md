# Customer-Churn-Prediction
The telecommunications industry faces a significant challenge with customer churn, where customers discontinue their service subscriptions with the company. High churn rates can lead to revenue loss and impact the company's bottom line.
Therefore, predicting customer churn accurately is crucial for telecom companies to implement targeted retention strategies and maintain customer satisfaction.

Develop a predictive model for customer churn prediction using machine learning techniques. By analyzing historical customer data, including demographics, usage patterns, and service subscription details, train several machine learning models to predict whether a customer is likely to churn or not. This predictive model will enable the telecommunications company to proactively identify customers at risk of churn and take appropriate retention actions to mitigate churn rates and preserve revenue.
